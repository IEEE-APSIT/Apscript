                                    <p><b>M6.</b> The Mid-day Meal Scheme is a school meal programme of the
                                        Government of India and is designed to improve the nutritional
                                        standing of school-age children nationwide. The programme supplies
                                        free lunches on working days for children in primary and upper primary
                                        classes in Government schools. Serving 120,000,000 children in over
                                        1,265,000 schools and Education Guarantee Scheme centers, it is the
                                        largest of its kind in the world. Student teams are expected to build
                                        machine vision solutions to monitor the activities under the Mid-day
                                        Meal Scheme. Solution Expected: As the Mid-Day Meal program runs
                                        in schools across the country, continuous auditing and monitoring of
                                        the program might be challenging. Typical Auditing and Monitoring
                                        could involve: Ensuring the number of students that took meals is the
                                        same number reported. Lunch served is the same as the
                                        published/reported menu. Alerting in case of discrepancy and capability
                                        to centrally see past records / proof (numbers and visual) for any
                                        school. To design modules based on the above mentioned activities,
                                        video feed shall be provided to the student teams. These feeds shall
                                        come from the Meraki security camera. Typically, these shall come
                                        from the actual / imitated site i.e. schools, food serving area etc.
                                        Student teams are expected to explore the capabilities of Meraki
                                        camera’s inbuilt Machine learning (ML) modules and develop solutions
                                        around it. E.g. counting students, object recognition etc. Meraki
                                        security camera also has an inbuilt functionality to capture snapshot
                                        photos. Teams are expected to generate their own database based on
                                        the region of interest and features they wish to extract to develop ML
                                        models. Along with the expectations of Auditing & Monitoring the
                                        student teams should also propose innovative ideas (backed with
                                        research) to extract additional information from above snapshots /
                                        photos. While architecting the entire system, teams may explore the
                                        scalability factor of the system. The evaluations shall be based on the
                                        following criteria: 1. Depth and research to understand Mid-Day meal
                                        scheme monitoring problems. 2. Depth of understanding of Meraki
                                        camera product capabilities use cases. 3. Depth and understanding of
                                        technologies proposed in solution. Resources:

                                    <p><b>W1.</b> Insurance has typically been a push product where the customer is
                                        usually sold an insurance by the agents. This makes the product
                                        marketing/ sales cost too high due to low conversion rates on
                                        insurance sales. It can be said that two factors contribute to this: 1.
                                        Insurance being viewed as an expense rather than a protection 2. The
                                        long and non-engaging information capture process which is required
                                        to issue the insurance. At APSIT, we are looking to solve this problem
                                        by providing a website as an engagement tool, which also helps you
                                        manage your health better. This website will also act as a source for
                                        insurance sales basis the data provided by the consumer. Gamification
                                        has emerged as a tool in the financial industry to convert the existing
                                        processes (non- engaging) into exciting activities. Some examples of
                                        the same can be capturing relevant information through quizzes (on
                                        say, world heart day) or health score generators (answer these
                                        questions to get your health score/ heart age).</p>
                                    <p><b>W2.</b> Servers are the crux of our IT infrastructure and are often exposed to
                                        great risk. The servers are covered under the layer of firewall, but they
                                        are still vulnerable and require security measures. The major concern
                                        is the source of threat. Extensive usage of remote connectivity causes improper
                                        security and lack of monitoring measures on remote
                                        networking equipment. It is required to keep an eye on the wrong
                                        doers, the data thieves and their work pattern. APSIT has about 30

                                        or just a solution to a simple math’s question should get some points or
